      <p>
        I am a Sofware Engineer. I currently work in media signaling for WebRTC communications. I mainly deal with Java
        microservices for the backend. Familiar with Spring Boot and everything that comes with that. I have dealt with
        AWS a fair bit to deploy my branches to test stuff and used tools to look at logs and fix bugs. I have written
        so
        many tests too. JUnit, so, many, test. Unit tests, Integration tests, End to End tests. And lots of mocking!
        I also have some experience with CICD tools like Jenkins. Also, I think I am not too bad on the frontend. I
        enjoy
        coding React. I used to kind of hate JavaScript but as time passes I've started to fall in love with it.

      <p>I would attach my cv but it seems to always be out of date.</p>
