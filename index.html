        I am a Sofware Engineer. I currently work in media signaling for WebRTC communications. I mainly deal with
        Java microservices on the backend side of things. Familiar with Spring Boot and everything that comes with that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have dealt with AWS a fair bit too, by deploying branches to test features and to debug code in real-life
        scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prevent bugs from occurring I always make sure to write enough tests. I have written so many tests, unit
        tests, integration tests, end to end tests...JUnit and Mockito are my go-tos.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have some experience with CICD tools like Jenkins. </p>
      <p>
        Even though I don't do much front end development I enjoy using React. I used to kind of hate JavaScript but as
        time passes I've started to fall in love with it. Though why does everything need to be a friggin promise am I
        right.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would attach my cv but it seems to always be out of date.
